# Course Reflection

## What I Learned
- How to use `git status` and `git commit`.
- How to create branches and push changes.
- Basic Markdown formatting for documentation.

## What I Am Still Confused About
- The difference between `merge` and `rebase`.
- Best practices for handling merge conflicts.

### Conclusion
I found this course informative, but I need more practice with advanced Git workflows.
